# The Entry-Level Quality Assurance Salaries That Bootcamp Grads Earn

Demand for quality assurance (QA) engineers is growing as software development and use not only increases but also becomes much more complex.

But it’s not just stability that makes this job appealing for many. The work itself can be incredibly rewarding and creatively challenging. Not to mention, the salary potential is in line with, if not greater than, other tech roles out there — and yes, for entry-level folks, too. The best part is that **anyone can break into QA engineering with the right training and mentality**.

## What is quality assurance, anyway?

Quality assurance is about building safe, secure, and highly functional software. The job of a QA engineer is to follow along the entire development process — from ideation to launch — to catch bugs and mistakes in code, test products and services for usability, and preempt possible hiccups or failures.

## QA engineer salaries by specialization

There are several routes you can take in QA engineering, all of which are lucrative in both the short and long term. Here are some of the most common **entry-level** jobs in the industry.

### QA Analyst  
**Average entry-level salary:** **$62,218 / year**

QA analyst is many people’s starting point into the world of quality assurance, mainly because many QA analyst roles don’t require knowing how to write code (although programming expertise is still valuable). These roles lean on data analysis, research, problem-solving, analytical thinking, and a strong attention to detail.

### Manual QA Tester  
**Average entry-level salary:** **$56,984 / year**

Manual QA testers test and debug software without automation tools. They may perform:

- **White-box testing** (working with the code and backend)
- **Black-box testing** (testing the product like an end user)

This role is ideal for people who enjoy breaking things and spotting edge cases.

### QA Automation Engineer  
**Average entry-level salary:** **$77,323 / year**

Automation engineers build systems that automatically test software. These roles typically require programming knowledge in languages like **Python** or **C#**, along with tools such as:

- Selenium (web)
- Appium (mobile)
- Postman (APIs)

Automation skills significantly boost earning potential early on.

### Cloud QA Engineer  
**Average entry-level salary:** **$83,806 / year**

Cloud QA engineers test applications hosted in cloud environments. Alongside testing and coding skills, they need familiarity with cloud platforms and frameworks. As more companies move infrastructure to the cloud, this role keeps growing.

### Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)  
**Average entry-level salary:** **$104,157 / year**

SDETs sit at the intersection of software engineering and QA. They write production-level code *and* test it. Their deep understanding of how systems are built makes them incredibly valuable — and well-paid.

To move into this role, focus on:
- Strong programming fundamentals
- Automation frameworks
- System-level thinking
