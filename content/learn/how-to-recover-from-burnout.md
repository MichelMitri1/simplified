# How to Recover from Burnout

You know it in your bones: you’re burned out. You look back on the times you felt vibrant, curious, engaged, and they seem alien to you. Now, you’re slogging through the workday. And it’s hollowing you out inside. You’re not alone:

- **66%** of workers in America are dealing with some form of burnout according to a recent study.  
- **76%** of respondents to another study said that workplace stress has led to depression or anxiety.  
- **36%** of participants in yet another study said their organizations weren’t doing anything at all to address employee burnout.

So now it’s time to make a change. It’s time to figure out how to recover from burnout. And right now, we’ll say there is hope — recovering from burnout is absolutely possible. There’s a lot to talk about here, so let’s dive in.

## What is burnout?

Burnout is a mental and physical state of exhaustion that usually results from chronic workplace stress, although caregiving can also lead to burnout. It’s more than “being tired.” It’s a syndrome recognized by the WHO that is defined by chronic lack of energy, cynicism about one’s job, and an irreconcilable reduction in workplace effectiveness.

## What causes burnout?

Burnout is caused by chronic stress, usually at work. This stress can arise due to factors such as unreasonably high workloads, low control over your own work and responsibilities, and unhealthy work environments that range from unsupportive to fully toxic. A lack of work-life balance and a values mismatch between you and your organization can also be contributing factors.

If you want to know how to deal with burnout, the first step is to know how it occurs in the first place. There are three main categories under which most of the work-based causes fall:

### 1) Unreasonable expectations

This is the big one when it comes to burnout. Within this category, there are two key contributors:

#### Excessive workload
There’s only so much that can be expected of a person in a single day. When you are asked to deliver more than can be reasonably expected of you, you’re essentially set up to fail. When you don’t meet the unreachable goal, your self-esteem might begin to erode, and as a result, your belief in your self-efficacy will also plummet. As you keep getting assigned more than a person can handle, this can lead to a downward spiral for your mental (and physical) health.

#### Unrealistic deadlines
Having a lot to do isn’t always a bad thing. The main way it can lead to burnout is when it’s combined with deadlines under which the work is clearly unfeasible. Combined, these factors will force you to either constantly exceed your capacity for work tasks or fall short. Exceeding your limits leaves you little time or energy to do anything other than work and recover. Over time, a flattening of your experience to “work and sleep” robs you of key sources of value human beings need to stay mentally and physically healthy.

### 2) Chaos

We’re not talking about Brownian motion. We mean chaos endemic to how a company operates. Burnout can show up here in two typical ways:

#### Willful ambiguity
Low levels of ambiguity are normal. But when something is expected of you and you can’t figure out what it is or when it’s due—even after repeatedly asking—burnout can follow. A lack of clarity forces you to work on projects you *hope* are correct, and never knowing if you’re meeting expectations creates powerlessness.

#### Lack of control
If you don't have any say in your schedule, decisions that impact your work, or how you complete tasks, this can fuel powerlessness, which can morph into professional cynicism — one of burnout’s core symptoms.

---

### 3) Toxicity

Workplace toxicity is sinister: it blocks thriving and drives mental strain. Common causes include:

#### Unhealthy work relationships
If your boss won’t support you, or you’re regularly in conflict with coworkers (including bullying), you’ll struggle to feel secure. That can keep you stuck in hypervigilance (fight-or-flight always on), which drains you fast.

#### Unfair treatment
Favoritism, inconsistent policy enforcement, unfair pay, arbitrary punishments—these break the social contract. Resentment and disengagement follow, and your sense of efficacy collapses.

---

## Beyond the workplace

Burnout often stems from work, but not always. Personal factors can contribute too.

For example:
- Family crises that demand time and emotional energy  
- People-pleasing (difficulty saying “no”)  
- Perfectionism (setting unrealistic standards)  

Even in a “good” job, these can increase burnout risk.

## Burnout symptoms and signs of burnout at work

We’ve all been tired, but not all of us have experienced burnout. If you’re asking **“What does burnout feel like?”** check this list:

### Exhaustion
Not just tired — drained to the point where normal tasks feel impossible. (This can overlap with depression; consider professional help.)

### Disengagement
Cynicism and frustration lead you to detach. You stop believing anything can improve, and numbness takes over.

### Diminished functioning
Performance drops at work *and* in life: forgetfulness, poor concentration, brain fog. You might struggle with shows, appointments, or even meal planning.

### Physical manifestations
Stress is physical. Cortisol, headaches, digestive issues, insomnia, appetite changes, increased illness—burnout can hit the body hard.

## The 5 burnout recovery stages

Instead of just giving commands, here’s a roadmap based on the questions people actually ask themselves.

### Stage 1: Recognition

**How do I know if I’m really burned out or just tired or stressed?**

Acute stress ≠ burnout. Burnout is chronic. Ask yourself:
- Are you having physical symptoms?
- Has this lasted a long time?
- Are you regularly struggling to keep up with normal duties?

If most answers are yes, burnout is likely.

**How can I stop feeling like a failure for not being able to handle it?**

This is a trap: burnout isn’t a personal failing. It’s usually a system problem.  
Try:
- Writing down **three things you did well** each day  
- Reconnecting with supportive people  
- Talking to a mental health professional  

---

### Stage 2: Relief

**What can I do right now to feel less exhausted?**

Start with disconnection:
- Turn off notifications  
- Stop re-entering the stress loop  

Then:
- Try breathing / meditation (even a few minutes)
- Listen to music, eat something, sit quietly
- Do something restorative (not doom-scrolling)

**How can I stop bringing work stress home?**

Try:
- A hobby commitment (something outside work with meaning)
- Exercise after work (proven stress reducer)
- Firm boundaries (next stage)

---

### Stage 3: Boundaries

**How do I set boundaries at work without guilt?**

Remind yourself: *this is a job, not your identity.*

Practical moves:
- Remove work accounts from personal devices  
- Leave your laptop at the office (if possible)  
- Don’t respond outside work hours  
- Communicate clearly: “I’m unavailable after 5 p.m.”

**What habits or routines will help me recover?**

Helpful routines:
- Consistent sleep schedule  
- Journaling  
- Daily movement (doesn’t have to be intense)  
- Device-free wind-down time before bed  

You stop the harm. Then you start the healing.

---

### Stage 4: Direction

**Should I quit my job, or can I recover while staying?**

You *can* recover while staying, but it’s harder. You’ll need:
- Boundaries  
- Healthy routines  
- Practice saying “no”  
- Pushback against work encroaching on life  

But if nothing improves and the system won’t change, quitting might be necessary.

**What’s the best way to talk to my boss or colleagues about burnout?**

Preparation helps:
- Talk with trusted coworkers first  
- If burnout is widespread, a group approach can be stronger  
- Bring evidence your boss values (missed deadlines, productivity drop, sick days)  
- Focus on solutions, not blame  
  - Extend deadlines  
  - Add headcount  
  - Redistribute workload  

In severe cases, include HR or leadership.

---

### Stage 5: Reconnection

**How do I find motivation again when I feel so empty?**

Start small:
- Celebrate tiny wins
- Track accomplishments to reconnect effort → outcome

Also consider:
- A workshop, conference, or class  
- Revisiting what excited you about your field  
- Trying something new to refresh perspective

**How long does it take to recover from burnout?**

Anywhere from **weeks to over a year**, depending on severity. Mild cases can improve with rest + boundaries. Severe cases may need therapy, medical support, or major life/work changes.
