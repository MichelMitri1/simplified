# How to Answer “Why Should We Hire You?”

The process of applying for a tech job can sometimes feel like it was designed to be confusing. And when you do land an interview, you might start wondering if each interview question is purpose-built to trip you up.

“So, tell me about yourself.”  
“What are your greatest strengths?”  
“What are your greatest weaknesses?”

It can be tempting to reply with snark, especially if you’ve been interviewing forever:

> “Well, I’m an Aquarius, so that should tell you all you need to know. My greatest strength is my humility, and my greatest weakness is that I just care too much.”

Resist the urge 😭  
Each one of these questions deserves its own deep dive, but today we’re focusing on one of the trickiest:

**“Why should we hire you?”**

If you’re applying for a tech job—especially if you’re switching careers—here’s how to answer it with confidence.

---

## Why are you asked “Why should we hire you?”

Interviewers ask this to see if you:
- Understand what the role actually requires
- Can clearly explain your value
- Know what makes you different from other candidates

They’re checking your:
- Self-awareness  
- Preparation  
- Communication skills  
- Genuine interest in the role  

A strong answer also makes it easier for hiring managers to justify choosing *you* during internal discussions.

## How to prepare your answer

### 1. Study the job description
Read the listing carefully and identify **3–5 core requirements** (technical skills, soft skills, experience).

Then:
- Match each requirement to something on your resume
- Prepare examples that show you’ve already done similar work

This lets you speak directly to what they care about most.

---

### 2. Identify what makes you different
Ask yourself:
- Why *me* instead of another candidate?
- What combination of skills or experiences do I bring?

This could be:
- A unique career background
- A rare mix of skills
- Strong results in past roles

Whatever it is, make sure it directly connects to the company’s needs.

---

### 3. Prepare real success stories (STAR method)
Have **2–3 concrete examples** ready using STAR:

- **Situation** – Context  
- **Task** – What you were responsible for  
- **Action** – What you did  
- **Result** – What happened (use numbers if possible)

Real examples beat generic claims every time.

---

### 4. Connect your goals to the company’s goals
Research:
- The company’s mission
- Their recent work
- Where they’re headed

Then explain:
- Why this role fits your long-term goals
- How you’ll help them succeed

This shows you’re strategic and not just job-hopping.

---

### 5. Practice out loud
Aim for:
- **60–90 seconds**
- Confident, natural delivery

Practice helps you:
- Cut filler words
- Improve pacing
- Sound authentic instead of rehearsed

## Sample answer structures

### “Because I already have relevant experience”

Employers care most about skills—both technical and soft.

Use STAR to frame your experience:

**Example STAR breakdown:**
- **Situation:** Externship with a game localization studio  
- **Task:** Identify high-demand localization languages  
- **Action:** Applied ML + NLP to analyze user reviews  
- **Result:** Built a model with 98% precision

**Sample response:**
> “You should hire me because I already have experience that directly applies to this role. During an externship with a game localization company, I helped analyze user reviews using machine learning and NLP to identify which languages should be prioritized next. The model we built achieved 98% precision, and the insights were used to guide the company’s expansion strategy.”

---

### “Because I have a strong portfolio”
No experience? No problem.

Portfolios matter more than resumes for early-career candidates.

Recruiters look for:
- Working projects
- Clear design
- Real functionality

> “Your portfolio shows what your resume can’t.”

Highlight:
- Bootcamp projects
- Personal builds
- Hackathons
- Independent work

These prove you can actually do the job.

---

### “Because my previous career gives me an edge”
Non-tech backgrounds can be a **huge advantage** when paired with tech skills.

Examples:
- Teachers → EdTech developers  
- Psych majors → Mental health platforms  
- Sales → Product or growth roles  

Hiring managers often want **domain expertise + tech skills**.

Explain how your background:
- Gives you deeper insight into users
- Helps you communicate better
- Solves real-world problems

### “Convince me to hire you”
- Skip fluff
- Highlight 3 relevant wins
- Use numbers
- Show excitement

### “What are your three strengths?”
- Pick strengths that matter for *this* role
- Back each one with a real example
- Mix hard + soft skills

### “Why are you a good fit for this position?”
- Reference the job description

- Demonstrate culture fit

## If you have no prior experience
Focus on:
- Transferable skills
- Projects, internships, volunteering
- Your ability to learn fast

Emphasize:
- Curiosity
- Adaptability
- Motivation

Example:
> “I may be early in my career, but I’ve consistently learned new tools quickly and applied them in real projects…”

## Get extra help with a career coach
Career coaches help you:
- Refine answers
- Practice mock interviews
- Polish portfolios
- Tailor responses to *specific* roles

They help turn “good answers” into **hire-me answers**.

If you want to stand out, this is one of the biggest cheat codes available.
