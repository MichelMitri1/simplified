## The many roles within the GameDev industry

GameDev, short for game development, is the process of creating and designing video games. Storytellers, designers, and developers collaborate to bring game ideas to life. Games often have a team of specialists to, including:

- **Game Designer:** Creates the core concept and mechanics of the game to ensure that it’s engaging and enjoyable.
- **Programmer:** Writes the code for the game using programming languages and handles aspects like gameplay, physics, AI, and more.
- **Artist:** Develops visual elements, such as characters, environments, and props, using 2D or 3D art and animation techniques.
- **Sound Designer:** Creates sound effects, music, and voiceovers for the game’s atmosphere and immersion.
- **Writer:** Develops the game’s narrative, including storylines, lore, character arcs, and dialogues.
- **QA Tester:** Tests gameplay, performance, and compatibility to ensure the game is free of bugs.

**Note:** Game development and game design are different aspects of the game creation process.

- Game development is about creating code. It’s the technical and programming side of building a video game. (e.g. game engine, AI behavior, and so on)
- Game design is about creating rules. It’s the process of designing the gameplay, storyline, objectives, and overall experience of the game.

Essentially, game developers only work on code-based games. Game designers also create tabletop games, party games, and other non-programmable games.

While the roles of artists, sound/game designers, and writers are immense, we’re going to focus on the technical side of game development.

## What you need to know before joining GameDev

To break into the game development industry, it’s beneficial to have gaming experience. Familiarity with a wide range of game genres and styles helps newcomers grasp the important aspects of good gameplay. Also, knowing different styles of games helps you identify industry trends and potential areas for innovation.

For industry newcomers, possibly the best way to start working in GameDev is to become a quality assurance (QA) technician. This position helps even non-programming beginners gain insider knowledge of the game production process. Working as testers, individuals familiarize themselves with crucial development milestones and learn how different components come together to create a complete gaming experience.

In the end, the core requirement for game development roles is, of course, coding skills. Let’s now dive deeper into what the technical side of the industry looks like.

## Most common video game development tools

At the heart of any video game, there’s the game engine — the software that developers use to build the game’s mechanics. The engine is responsible for handling tasks like physics simulation, rendering graphics, and player control.

According to GameDeveloper.com, Unreal is the most popular engine, used in 25.6% of games. Unity is the second with 13.2%. However, Unreal Engine isn't available for free. We recommend that beginners start with free engines that come with clear documentation, such as Construct 2, Pygame, and LÖVE.

Check out the table below to learn more of the most popular game engines.

Still, an engine is just a tool. In order to fully utilize its capabilities and start building a game, a developer needs to write code. Their coded commands tell the engine how the game’s mechanics, physics, user controls, and other components should work.

Code is written in one of the programming languages. The choice of language depends on the game engine used for the project, as certain engines have a native or preferred language. As you can see in the table above, Unity runs on C# while Unreal Engine primarily uses C++.

## Key programming languages in GameDev

- **C#:** This is the primary language for indie developers who prefer using Unity due to its free features. C# boasts a clean, easy-to-understand syntax. It’s often chosen for developing games suited to various platforms (PC, consoles, mobile).
- **C++:** This is the main programming language used in Unreal Engine and many in-house engines of large studios. Compared to C#, it lets programmers control the device “down to the metal” with all its hardware. However, C++ is fairly complex for beginners.
- **JavaScript:** Occasionally used in game development, JavaScript is well-suited for creating browser-based games. Since it’s not as flexible as C++, developers use it to make small games and prototypes, often combining them with HTML5 and web technology libraries.
- **Python:** This language is not widely known for game development, yet it allows developers to create simple and moderately complex games. Python’s readability and ease of use may appeal to beginners, but it’s not as performant or extensively adopted in the industry as C++ or C#.
- **Lua:** Although not the typical language for GameDev, Lua excels at handling game logic, AI, and configuration settings. Its lightweight nature and ease of integration make it a popular choice for modding, scripting, and customization. The biggest downside is that Lua performs the poorest of the bunch in terms of market prospects.

## Where to learn game development skills

If you have zero experience with coding, your main task is to master programming skills first. One surefire way to do this is by completing online courses.

TripleTen’s Software Engineering Bootcamp is a comprehensive program designed for beginners who want to work as programmers and coders. The curriculum includes theory, practice, and project-based learning. Students also receive line-by-line code reviews from professional software engineers, helping them further refine their skills.

The bootcamp provides career support, such as guidance for resume and cover letter writing, LinkedIn profile creation, mock interviews, and job searching. Additionally, you’ll have the opportunity to work on real-life projects through externships at actual companies. Our bootcamp graduates enjoy an 89% employment rate.

And if you don’t secure a job within six months of graduation, you’re eligible for a tuition refund.

As soon as you’re comfortable with coding, the next step is to move toward game development. You'll find that the internet is a treasure trove of educational tutorials, guides, and other resources. For example, take advantage of the official documentation from game engine developers:

- Unity manual and learning platform  
- Unreal Engine  
- Construct 3  
- Pygame  
- LÖVE  

Engaging with fellow developers through online communities such as Reddit, Discord, and YouTube helps GameDev beginners build connections and improve their skills. Another option is to participate in game development events or hackathons. They expand your portfolio, and some collaborations might even lead to potential employment offers.

To track event announcements, as well as recent news and open positions in companies, check out GameDeveloper.com (formerly Gamasutra) and GameDev.net. Both websites are invaluable sources of industry knowledge.
