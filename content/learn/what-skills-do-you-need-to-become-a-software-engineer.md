# What Skills Do You Need to Become a Software Engineer?

There’s a good reason why software engineer remains a top ten in-demand tech job, with overall employment projected to grow 16% by 2034. This role is essential to delivering the tools that make everything digital possible!

If you’re considering software engineering as a career path, it’s helpful to know what skills will set you up for success. Here’s a breakdown, plus some extra info on areas of specialization.

## What technical skills does a software engineer need to succeed?

Programming language skills are still what matter most in software engineering. The languages US companies want most right now are Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, Go, and Rust. Python has really taken off because you can use it for nearly everything: web development, machine learning, automation, you name it.

### Programming language demand

| Rank | Language | Estimated demand percentage (%) | Notes on demand and use cases |
|-----:|----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | Python | 40–46% | Widely demanded for AI, machine learning, data engineering, automation, and back-end development. Most recruiters seek Python skills. |
| 2 | JavaScript | 38–42% | Core language for front-end and full-stack development; ubiquitous in web projects with frameworks like React and Node.js. |
| 3 | Java | 35–40% | Used throughout enterprise software, Android apps, big data, and back-end systems. |
| 4 | TypeScript | 25–30% | Increasingly popular for larger web applications and safer JavaScript development. |
| 5 | Go (Golang) | 12–15% | Growing usage in cloud-native, microservices, and infrastructure applications. |
| 6 | C# | 20–23% | Applied in enterprise software, game development with Unity, and integration with the Microsoft tech stack. |
| 7 | Rust | 9–12% | Niche but rapidly growing in systems programming, blockchain, and security-critical software. |
| 8 | C++ | 18–20% | Vital for high-performance computing, games, and embedded systems. |
| 9 | Swift | 12–14% | The core language for mobile app development for iOS and macOS. |
| 10 | SQL | 30–35% | Essential skill for database management across various applications. For software engineers, this is an important addition to have but not the basis of a coding career. |

Don’t forget, though: AI productivity tools and code assistants are becoming must-have skills now. Tools like Cursor AI and Microsoft Copilot are changing how developers work, and companies want engineers who can use these tools well without letting code quality slip.

But knowing how to write code is just the start. You also need solid data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills. Data structures are the building blocks of any software program, while algorithms are the methods used to access and manipulate that stored data. A foundation in math, logical thinking, and computer architecture is helpful here, but don’t worry if that’s not you. Most bootcamps will help you get up to speed and the rest is practice, practice, practice.

Additionally, engineers have to understand Big-O notation, sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort, searching techniques like binary search, dynamic programming, recursion, and graph theory. This know-how directly affects whether you can write code that's efficient and scales well.

Likewise, version control systems, especially Git and GitHub, are must-haves for working with others and managing code in modern development. You need to know how to handle code changes, do code reviews, and keep repositories organized. Every role expects it.

Last, but not least, testing and debugging. Just like a restaurant wouldn’t add a new dish to its menu without testing it multiple times, software engineers must perform quality assurance checks before releasing new software or updates to consumers. They need to know how to test code to find errors and how to debug code to fix them. While AI and other tools facilitate this process, it’s still important to have a solid foundation in testing for any software engineer role.

## The technical skills software engineers need: By role

When it comes to career paths as a software engineer, you’ve got options. Knowing your destination will help you stay focused on acquiring the right skills along the way. Here are six examples of different types of software engineering roles and their related skills.

### Front-end developer skill set

Front-end developers build the parts of websites and applications that users see and interact with, e.g. the interface. A basic front-end technical skill set includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as familiarity with front-end concepts and terminology. Soft skills such as organization, attention to detail, and customer service are also key. In more detail, you need to know:

- HTML5 (semantic markup), CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid), and JavaScript (ES6+ features)
- Modern front-end frameworks and libraries like React.js (including hooks and server components), Vue.js, or Svelte
- Responsive and mobile-first design principles
- Performance optimization: lazy loading, code splitting, image compression (AVIF, WebP, SVG)
- Browser compatibility and debugging with Chrome DevTools and Lighthouse
- CSS preprocessors like Sass or TailwindCSS for modular stylesheets
- Version control (Git), build tools (Webpack, Vite), and CI/CD pipelines
- Basic back-end concepts such as APIs and RESTful services

### Back-end developer skill set

Back-end developers build the hidden parts of websites and applications, facilitating users’ interactions with internal data. Their contributions complement the work that front-end engineers perform. A basic back-end technical skill set includes JavaScript, Python, and Java. Soft skills such as humility, teamwork, listening, and clear communication are also key. Specifically, you’ll need to know:

- Back-end languages like Java, Python, Go, Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript), or C#
