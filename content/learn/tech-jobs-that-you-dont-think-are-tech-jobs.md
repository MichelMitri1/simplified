# Tech Jobs That You Don’t Think Are Tech Jobs

For decades, popular culture has kept alive a set of very narrow stereotypes about tech workers. These caricatures are often young, white, and male—like the software engineer who guzzles coffee by the gallon, or the socially skittish IT administrator hiding in a cave of wires.

The reality is, tech is a far more diverse and inclusive field than any TV show or movie wants you to believe. In fact, plenty of roles exist that don’t even require coding. To illustrate the possibilities, here’s a list of four rewarding careers that are great options for breaking into tech.

## Market Research Analyst

Market research analysts use qualitative and quantitative data to uncover insights on an organization’s customers, competitors, and marketing strategies. For example, they surface trends on consumer behavior, conduct market segmentation, and evaluate competitors.

They work closely with sales and marketing teams and communicate frequently with executives and high-level managers. Because of this, market research analysts need to be comfortable presenting findings and sharing strategic recommendations.

### Example responsibilities

- Monitoring and forecasting marketing and sales trends
- Measuring the effectiveness of marketing programs
- Collecting data such as surveys, questionnaires, and opinion polls
- Analyzing data using statistical software
- Converting data into reports
- Preparing and presenting findings to stakeholders

Even though market research analysts don’t code, the role relies heavily on technical skills like data collection, analysis, and visualization. Many work in tech companies, where data is a major competitive advantage.

### AC Slamet’s Story: Leaving TV for Tech

AC used to work 15-hour days as a producer for unscripted TV. Over time, the relentless pace took a toll on his health. Interested in working with data and having a more regular schedule, AC enrolled in what was then the TripleTen Data Analytics program (now Business Intelligence Analytics).

Three months after graduating, he landed a role as a data analyst at an advertising agency. He no longer works holidays and has energy for family life with his partner and dogs.

## UX/UI Designer

UX/UI designers support product or website development at every stage of the lifecycle to ensure the end product is visually appealing, functional, and easy to use. Their work spans information architecture, visual design, and usability testing.

They collaborate closely with developers, product managers, and other stakeholders, advocating for user needs and high-quality experiences throughout development.

### Example responsibilities

- Collecting user requirements with product managers and engineers
- Conducting user research to understand needs, behaviors, and pain points
- Prototyping and wireframing design concepts
- Creating UI mockups that show how products look and function
- Running functionality testing
- Resolving usability issues from testing and feedback

Although coding isn’t central to the role, basic technical knowledge can be helpful. This makes UX/UI design a “technical-lite” career that blends creativity and problem-solving.

### Occupational outlook

- **Median annual wage:** $92,750
- **Job growth (2023–2033):** 8%
- **Projected annual openings:** 16,500

## Business Intelligence Analyst

Business intelligence (BI) analysts collect, process, and analyze company data such as revenue, customer demographics, and website traffic. They often sit within BI teams or operate alongside engineering teams.

BI analysts use tools from Google, Microsoft, or Amazon to visualize data and drive decision-making across departments—from sales and marketing to operations and hiring.

### Example responsibilities

- Cleaning and enriching data
- Building or editing data models
- Translating data into dashboards and charts
- Presenting trends, predictions, and insights
- Participating in project meetings and sprints

BI analysts may use programming languages like SQL or R, along with ETL tools such as Informatica or Talend. While more technical than UX/UI or market research roles, they are still less code-heavy than software engineering or data science.

### Occupational outlook

- **Median annual wage:** $80,249
- **Job growth (2023–2033):** 21%
- **Projected total openings:** 284,100

> “When the person training me—someone who’s been doing this for 10 years—gets a piece of code right, he still fist bumps me saying, ‘Heck yeah. Score one for the data team.’”

### Example responsibilities

- Extracting information from datasets
- Identifying correlations and patterns

- Communicating with stakeholders

Data analysts are in high demand, especially in tech, where data-driven decisions are critical.
