## What is generative AI?

Generative AI is a general term for artificial intelligence (AI) systems that use intricate digital neural networks to analyze and learn from large datasets. They apply that analysis to form predictive algorithms that can create novel content such as text, audio, code, images, or videos as requested by the user.

## How does generative AI work?

Generative AI works by applying advanced statistical models. Neural networks are trained on data so they can grasp implicit connections, styles, and aesthetic specifics. Once trained, these networks use statistical models based on this training data to predict the next pixel to be displayed or the next word in the sentence, for example.

### In more detail

Generative AI platforms start with data collection. They intake mountains upon mountains of data, clean it, and then tokenize it, encoding non-numerical information like text into numerical representations that a network can process. Then, the model trains.

Taking the specific example of generative AI writing tools, this involves the model learning which words tend to follow which other words and in which contexts (to be fair, one word isn’t always one token, but for the sake of the example, let’s simplify). Then, once it has a framework for the statistical probability of which words follow which others, it starts its own experiments, predicting the text that’s likely to come next. Depending on how the model is set up, it may check its accuracy using its own verification methods, but many of the best AI automation tools nowadays also incorporate human feedback.

Once trained, generative AI applies this statistical modeling within the context set by the user’s prompt to produce the content requested.

## The weaknesses of AI tools

That all makes this tech sound like wizardry, but it does have its drawbacks and limitations.

Generative AI tools are massive prediction machines. That means they don’t know things per se — they predict what’s most likely to be the next word in a sentence (if we stay with our writing example).

Because of that, these tools can **hallucinate**, i.e., respond confidently but incorrectly. So the human prompting these tools should keep an eye out for information that could be off-base.

This also ties into another limitation: depending on the base model, there may be a **knowledge cutoff date**. Some models need retraining to update their stores of information, so they’re only as informed as their last training data. Others incorporate internet access, so they can stay current.

## How to do proper prompt engineering with gen AI tools

One last piece of advice: to use these tools, you’re going to need to know how to properly prompt them.

Proper gen AI tool prompting is all about **specificity, context, and clarity**. Give the tool the maximum amount of information: background, any data you have (be careful with sensitive info), the outcome you want, format requests, and tone needed. Also, don’t ask for something too complex at once — break compound requests into parts.

### Guide to properly prompting gen AI tools

#### Be clear and specific

Avoid prompts such as “help me with my report.” Instead, ask for precisely what you want. For example:

- “Please come up with an outline for three slides for a presentation about the economic implications of generative voice AI.”

#### Provide input data and context

Give data (carefully), examples to emulate, audience info, etc. The more useful input you provide, the better the output.

#### Break compound requests into steps

For bigger tasks, give step-by-step instructions such as:

- “First, analyze the data. Then, generate the two best possible pieces of content to send out based on that analysis. Finally, suggest which of the two has the highest likelihood of success.”

#### For more complex tasks, consider prompt engineering techniques

Use tactics like:

- **Role-based prompting** (e.g., “You are a math tutor” or “You are a marketing analyst”)
- **Chain-of-thought prompting** (asking the model to follow logical steps to reduce errors)

#### Iterate

Review the output and compare it to your expectations. Treat it like a conversation: give feedback, say what worked/what didn’t, and ask it to try again.
