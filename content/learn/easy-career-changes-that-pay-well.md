# Easy Career Changes That Pay Well

You wake up and turn off your alarm. It was supposed to be a pleasant experience, but even the sweet sounds of birds chirping or your favorite tune can’t distract you from the reality ahead: it’s time to go to work and grind.

It doesn’t have to be this way. No matter where you are in life, you still have options. A high-stress, low-paying job isn’t the end-all and be-all. A career switch is possible — and could improve your life in a myriad of ways.

If you’re looking for easy career changes that pay well, you’re best off starting in the tech industry. It’s no secret that tech jobs are both abundant and lucrative. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) puts the average annual salary for computer and information technology occupations at $105,990. Considering that the median wage for all occupations is $49,500, that’s a lot more money in the bank.

In addition, the BLS reports that around 317,700 new tech job openings are projected each year because of growth and interest in this sector as well as the need to replace talent as they leave or retire.

## Why IT Roles Are Easy, Well-Paying Jobs

What makes tech roles the best career change jobs out there, besides the substantial and reliable income? For one thing, making a career change into tech is a lot easier and faster than switching to another high-paying field like law or healthcare.

While you need a degree and years of training to become a doctor, lawyer, or nurse, you only need practical experience (and some easy-to-hone soft skills) to break into software engineering, data science, or AI automation — much of which can be developed outside the traditional classroom.

Online bootcamps are affordable, flexible, and attractive to employers. Eight out of ten employers say they’d hire candidates with non-traditional backgrounds. Additionally, 80% of students enter tech bootcamps with no prior experience, and 82% of graduates secure a tech job within six months.
