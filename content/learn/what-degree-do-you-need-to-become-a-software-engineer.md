# What Degree Do You Need to Become a Software Engineer?

It’s no secret that aspiring software engineers need specialized skills to break into the profession. But while a computer science degree is certainly helpful, it isn’t the only way to build expertise. In fact, with so many universities struggling to accommodate increased demand for computer science majors, alternative routes for learning are more important than ever.

Whatever your learning style, budget, or time allowance, there’s a path that’s right for you. Here’s a closer look at your options for meeting the education requirements for software engineers so you can make an informed decision to support your professional goals.

## Do You Need a College Degree to Become a Software Engineer?

The short answer is: **it depends**.

While entry-level and mid-level jobs tend to be more flexible on software engineer degree requirements, senior management positions might require them due to their leadership responsibilities.

A bachelor’s in computer science is the best degree, but one in a related field (such as engineering or software development) is often also sufficient.

Ultimately, the proof is in your portfolio and in being able to demonstrate expertise in software applications and systems through projects, work experience, certifications, training, and more.

## Alternative Education Paths

### Associate’s Degree

An associate’s degree is a two-year program designed to help you get your foot in the door with an entry-level, full-time software engineering position. These programs cover the basics of programming and web development and can also serve as a stepping stone toward a bachelor’s degree.

### Self-Teaching

Self-teaching is challenging but possible.

**How long does it take?**
- 12–24 months on average  
- $500–$2,000 (up to $8,000 with premium resources)

**What it takes to succeed**
- Master fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python)
- Build 2–3 complete, polished projects
- Contribute to open-source projects
- Write technical blog posts and strong README files
- Set realistic expectations about job hunting

Stack Overflow’s 2023 survey found that **80% of professional developers learned through online resources**, proving this path works if done right.

### Software Engineering Bootcamps

Bootcamps are structured programs designed to teach job-ready skills fast.

**Typical length**
- 9 months part-time  
- 4 months full-time  

**Why bootcamps work**
- Faster job placement (often within 6 months)
- Strong return on investment
- Career support (interview prep, resume help, referrals)

TripleTen reports an **82% employment rate** for graduates within six months.

### Online Certificates

Platforms like Coursera, edX, Udemy, AWS, Google, and Microsoft offer certificates that sit between self-teaching and bootcamps.

**Pros**
- Cheaper ($500–$8,000)
- Flexible schedules

**Cons**
- Limited employer weight unless paired with projects

AWS and Google Cloud certifications carry the most value when combined with real-world work.
