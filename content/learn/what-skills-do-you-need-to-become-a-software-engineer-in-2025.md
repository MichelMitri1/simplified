## What technical skills does a software engineer need to succeed?

Programming language skills are still what matter most in software engineering. The languages US companies want most right now are Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, Go, and Rust. Python has really taken off because you can use it for nearly everything: web development, machine learning, automation, you name it.

### Programming language demand snapshot

| Rank | Language | Estimated demand percentage (%) | Notes on demand and use cases |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | Python | 40–46% | Widely demanded for AI, machine learning, data engineering, automation, and back-end development. Most recruiters seek Python skills. |
| 2 | JavaScript | 38–42% | Core language for front-end and full-stack development; ubiquitous in web projects with frameworks like React and Node.js. |
| 3 | Java | 35–40% | Used throughout enterprise software, Android apps, big data, and back-end systems. |
| 4 | TypeScript | 25–30% | Increasingly popular for larger web applications and safer JavaScript development. |
| 5 | Go (Golang) | 12–15% | Growing usage in cloud-native, microservices, and infrastructure applications. |
| 6 | C# | 20–23% | Applied in enterprise software, game development with Unity, and integration with the Microsoft tech stack. |
| 7 | Rust | 9–12% | Niche but rapidly growing in systems programming, blockchain, and security-critical software. |
| 8 | C++ | 18–20% | Vital for high-performance computing, games, and embedded systems. |
| 9 | Swift | 12–14% | The core language for mobile app development for iOS and macOS. |
| 10 | SQL | 30–35% | Essential skill for database management across various applications. For software engineers, this is an important addition to have but not the basis of a coding career. |

Don’t forget, though: AI productivity tools and code assistants are becoming must-have skills now. Tools like Cursor AI and Microsoft Copilot are changing how developers work, and companies want engineers who can use these tools well without letting code quality slip.

But knowing how to write code is just the start. You also need solid data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills. Data structures are the building blocks of any software program, while algorithms are the methods used to access and manipulate that stored data. A foundation in math, logical thinking, and computer architecture is helpful here, but don’t worry if that’s not you. Most bootcamps will help you get up to speed and the rest is practice, practice, practice.

Additionally, engineers have to understand Big-O notation, sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort, searching techniques like binary search, dynamic programming, recursion, and graph theory. This know-how directly affects whether you can write code that's efficient and scales well.

Likewise, version control systems, especially Git and GitHub, are must-haves for working with others and managing code in modern development. You need to know how to handle code changes, do code reviews, and keep repositories organized. Every role expects it.

Last, but not least, testing and debugging. Just like a restaurant wouldn’t add a new dish to its menu without testing it multiple times, software engineers must perform quality assurance checks before releasing new software or updates to consumers. They need to know how to test code to find errors and how to debug code to fix them. While AI and other tools facilitate this process, it’s still important to have a solid foundation in testing for any software engineer role.

## Top software engineer soft skills

In addition to technical capabilities like coding, software engineers need to nurture a wide variety of soft skills that help them thrive in their role. We already mentioned many of them in the section above, but here are the non-negotiables and why they are important:

- **Communication** skills are some of the most important soft skills you can have. Being able to communicate well lets you collaborate, resolve conflicts, and share knowledge across teams. Engineers need to explain complicated technical concepts clearly to everyone, whether they're talking to other engineers or people who don't have a technical background.
- **Teamwork and collaboration** matter in modern development, especially when you're using methodologies like Agile and DevOps. That means participating in code reviews, giving and getting feedback, pair programming, and working well in cross-functional teams.
- **Creative problem solving** keeps teams from going with the obvious solution. This includes coming up with multiple ways to tackle a problem, thinking outside the box, and optimizing for scalability and efficiency even when development cycles are tight.
- **Adaptability** to changing technologies enables coders to pick up new languages, frameworks, AI-assisted tools, or development methods quickly so their skills stay current and valuable.
- **Time and priority management** allows coders to juggle multiple tasks and deadlines effectively using Agile principles and tools like Jira or Trello to hit deadlines without sacrificing quality.
- **Empathy and emotional intelligence** are underrated but likewise crucial. Getting where your teammates are coming from, understanding their challenges, building an inclusive team culture, and being there for colleagues who are stressed or burned out helps a team cohere and deliver.
- **Leadership** is what lets coders run projects or initiatives even when they're not officially in charge. It inspires people to take ownership and work together.

## Tips for improving your skills

Whether you’re new to coding or have some prior experience, acquiring new skills involves learning of some kind. The good news is there are plenty of effective ways to improve what you know without going back to college (unless that’s your jam), both free and paid.

### Online courses and certifications

If you’re looking to uplevel your skills in a certain area, an online course from a trusted provider can be an efficient way to achieve your goals. Unlike bootcamps, which tend to be longer and more comprehensive, these courses focus on a specific topic or skill and are often shorter time investments.

Certifications are also helpful for showing ongoing professional development. As you grow, they give you credibility. AWS certifications are especially valuable in 2025. If you're in your first tech role, there's the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner for foundational knowledge. For associate-level, the AWS Certified Developer – Associate and AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate are both well-respected.

### Bootcamps

Coding bootcamps have become popular over the last decade as a way for people to transition into software engineering without the financial overhead of a college degree, and if you don’t have any prior tech background, they’re likely your best bet. The quality and legitimacy of a bootcamp can significantly impact the learning experience and future career prospects, though, so it’s important to verify the authenticity of a program before investing. Things like alum testimonials, accreditation, and job placement support are deciding factors.

### Conferences and communities

Attending industry events and joining online communities like GitHub or Stack Overflow are all important ways to grow software engineering skills through collaboration and networking. Connecting with other developers and sharing failures and successes demonstrates a commitment to knowledge sharing and shows off your collaboration skills.

### Books and white papers

Last, but not least, reading up on best practices is a smart way to supplement existing knowledge. And since books are long-form by design, they can dive into details that other ways of learning might not have space for. Mainstay titles include *The Programmatic Programmer* by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas and Robert C. Martin’s *Clean Code*. Here are four other coding book titles that we think are great for beginners.

## FAQ

### How should I list my skills on a software engineer resume?

To list your skills on a software engineer resume, it’s as easy as including a skills section. Break it into chunks like programming languages, frameworks, and tools (or whatever makes sense in your specific case). Pick eight to 12 skills you actually know (don't just stuff keywords in there). Then weave them into your work history section when you talk about specific projects. Match what the job posting asks for when you can.

### How can I become a top 1% engineer?

To become a top 1% engineer, get really, really good at the basics before jumping to advanced topics. Pick something specific to get great at. Build things constantly such as open source projects and actual solutions to real problems. Learn to talk about technical work in ways non-engineers understand. Ask for feedback even when it stings. Help newer folks when you can. Stay interested in what's coming next.

### What personality is best for engineers?

There isn’t one best personality for engineers. Quiet, heads-down coders can crush it. Chatty, people-oriented engineers can also lead amazing teams. What helps: being curious, not giving up when things break, caring about details, and rolling with changes. Work with what you've got. If you're naturally introverted, lean into focused work. If you're extroverted, maybe you'll end up bridging teams.

### What is the golden rule of coding?

The golden rule of coding is write for the person who reads it next, not for the computer. Code gets read way more than it gets written. Make it clear. Keep functions short and focused. Name things so they make sense. Comment the "Why," not the "What." Stick to whatever style your team uses. Future you (and your teammates) will thank you when it's time to change something six months later.

### What is the easiest software engineering field?

The easiest software engineering fields tend to be front-end web and mobile development because you see results right away. That visual feedback helps when you're learning. But "easiest" is relative. What clicks for you depends on how your brain works. Pick something you're genuinely interested in, not just what seems less hard. You’ll stick with it longer, and the difficulties will seem less daunting when they occur.

### What emerging technologies should software engineers learn?

In terms of emerging tech that software engineers should learn, AI and ML basics are high on the list. Additionally, cloud platforms are only becoming more crucial; pick one of the big three to start. Likewise, edge computing and serverless are worth knowing about, and WebAssembly might matter depending on what you do. But here's the thing: don't try to learn everything. Get your fundamentals down first, then specify as your career develops.

### What are typical salary ranges for entry-level software engineers in the US?

The range for entry-level software engineers in the US is roughly $70,000–$115,000 to start, but it depends a lot on where you are. Big tech cities like SF, Seattle, and New York? Think $89,000–$145,000, sometimes way more at major companies. Smaller cities might be $70,000–$107,000. Big tech firms and startups with funding tend to pay better. This is all just base pay, though; remember that total comp includes stock, bonuses, and benefits, not just your base salary.

### What are common skills that software engineering jobs test for in interviews?

Software engineering jobs tend to test for knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and system design. One heads-up: you'll likely code live in your tech interview, which is nerve-wracking. Grind LeetCode if you want to prep. Then, behavioral interviews dig into how you work with people and handle problems. This is where the STAR format shines.
