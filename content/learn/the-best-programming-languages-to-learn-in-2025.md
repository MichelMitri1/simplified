## What is a programming language?

A programming language is a set of instructions that lets humans communicate with computers and tell them to execute tasks. Like the natural languages that we speak or sign, programming languages have their own unique grammar, syntax, and structure.

Unlike natural languages, though, mistakes and typos render programming languages unintelligible. Computers are consistent in reading and performing tasks, so even a single mistake (such as a missing closed parenthesis) can prevent code from executing.

## The two categories of programming languages

### High level

- Most commonly used for software and web development  
- Relatively easy for humans to read  
- Harder for machines to understand and execute, requiring more time, resources, and a compiler  
- **Examples:** JavaScript, Java, Pascal, PHP, Python  

### Low level

- Tailored for computers  
- Run fast  
- Written primarily in binary  
- Used to execute very complex programs  
- Harder for humans to understand and learn  
- **Examples:** Assembly language, machine language  

**A note about compilers:** Languages like C++ use a compiler to convert sentences coders write into the binary form machines understand. Others like JavaScript have a built-in interpreter that allows programmers to translate commands and structures on the fly; these are simpler to use.

## Best programming languages to learn based on your career path

Your ideal path for your future programming career determines the best programming languages to learn. Below is a rundown of the best coding languages to pick up to achieve your career goals.

### General purpose languages

General-purpose languages are used to build a variety of apps and websites. They are relatively easy to learn and are a good starting point for beginners.

Python, Java, and C++ are the main general-purpose languages for beginners in software development. They are the best programming languages to start with to become a programming expert. After learning these languages, it’ll be easier to branch out into more specific programming fields.

### Web development languages

JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the main languages for web development. You should focus on them to become good at website and web app development.

This one splits two ways. JavaScript is still mandatory for front-end work, as the npm ecosystem keeps expanding every year, but TypeScript has taken over for anything serious or enterprise-level. The reality is you need both; learn JavaScript first to understand how things work, then switch to TypeScript when you're building real applications.

Start with JavaScript fundamentals such as DOM manipulation and async programming. Build a few small projects like a to-do app, calculator, or weather app. Once you've got that down, learn TypeScript while working with React or Next.js. You're probably looking at three to six months for JavaScript, after which you can more easily move into TypeScript.

### Mobile development languages

Kotlin, Java, and Swift are the best programming languages for mobile development. Kotlin and Java are used for Android apps, while Swift is used for iOS apps. These languages are crucial to getting a job as a mobile developer.

### Data science languages

Python, SQL, R, and Java are the most useful programming languages for data science and machine learning. These languages enable developers to build functional machine learning (ML) models that solve organizational problems.

### AI and machine learning languages

You're going to need Python, there's really no way around it. Python has all the ML libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and scikit-learn as well as the data tools such as NumPy and Pandas.

Here's what actually works: Get solid with Python basics first, then jump straight into scikit-learn and TensorFlow. Put some ML projects on GitHub so you have something to show. Figure six to 12 months to get to a junior level where you can start applying.

### Game development languages

C++, Java, JavaScript, Lua, and Python are the most popular languages for game development.

C++ is what AAA studios use for Unreal Engine. But if you're an indie developer or working with Unity, C# is more practical. For mobile games, you'll need Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android.

If you're just starting out, go with C# and Unity. The learning curve is gentler, and there's a huge community. Once you're comfortable, you can learn C++ later.

### Embedded systems and internet of things (IoT) languages

C++, Rust, Python, and Java are the most useful programming languages for embedded systems and IoT.

### Cloud and back-end infrastructure languages

Go and Rust are climbing fast for vital underlying tech.

Go is easier to learn and gets you working faster. Rust takes more patience but sets you up better long-term. Pick Go if you want quick results, Rust if you're building something that needs to be bulletproof or incredibly fast.
