# How to Become a QA Engineer

You’ve been there: a website or app is *supposed* to work and it’s just… not. At best, it’s annoying (text off the screen). At worst, it blocks important life stuff (like a login error on a doctor portal).

That’s where **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineers** come in: they find and document issues *before* users do.

Why QA is valuable:
- **40%** of large companies spend **25%+** of their budget on testing.
- **10%** more QA jobs are projected over the next 9 years (over **3x** faster than economy-wide growth).
- **71.5%** of orgs bring testers into planning from the start (QA is becoming part of strategy, not an afterthought).

## What is a QA engineer?

A **QA engineer** tests software to make sure it:
- works correctly
- matches requirements
- is stable across devices/environments

They work with developers to report bugs and verify fixes.

Testing can be:
- **Manual testing:** human imitates real user behavior
- **Automated testing:** scripts run tests repeatedly and at scale

## QA Engineer vs QA Tester

QA engineers typically do more strategy + automation work, while QA testers focus more on executing test cases.

| QA engineer | QA tester |
|---|---|
| Develops testing strategy | Executes testing strategy |
| Involved throughout dev lifecycle | Often joins later in lifecycle |
| Works cross-functionally | Works mostly with QA + dev teams |
| Often more automation-focused | Often more manual-focused |

> **Note:** Job titles vary a lot. Always read the actual job description.

## What does a QA engineer do?

QA engineers plan and run tests to ensure products meet quality standards.

### Key responsibilities
- **Requirement analysis:** confirm what the product *should* do  
- **Test plan & design:** build testing strategy + test cases  
- **Bug detection & documentation:** find issues and write clear reports  
- **Process monitoring:** ensure testing follows agreed workflows  
- **Communication:** align with stakeholders + dev team throughout the cycle

## A day in the life of a QA Engineer

### Morning
- Check bug tracker + emails
- Stand-up meeting (updates + blockers)
- Verify fixes that came in overnight
- Run **smoke tests** (login, checkout, core flows)

### Midday
- Lunch + flexibility (often task-based work)
- Respond to dev questions when needed (clarifying bugs)

### Afternoon
- Deep testing + bug documentation
- Reproduce bugs across environments
- Severity assessment (blocker vs minor UI issue)
- Automation folks may write/update scripts (stress tests, regression suites)

### Late afternoon
- Run **regression tests**
- Log any new issues
- Update docs and prep next day’s plan

## How to become a QA engineer

There’s no single “one path,” but there *are* common requirements.

### Qualifications you need
- **You don’t need a bachelor’s degree**
- You *do* need **real skills + proof (projects/portfolio)**

You can start with free resources (YouTube, docs), but as you get serious, structured learning helps (bootcamps, courses, mentorship).

## Required QA engineering skills

| Hard skills | Soft skills |
|---|---|
| Version control (Git) | Communication |
