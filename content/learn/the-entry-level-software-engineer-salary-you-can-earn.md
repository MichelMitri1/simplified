# The Entry-Level Software Engineer Salary You Can Earn

Despite tech layoffs, demand for software engineers continues strong with 129,200 annual openings projected through 2034. The career prospects don't stop there—entry-level salaries are up 8-12% from 2024, and remote work opportunities remain prevalent, with 80% of roles offering hybrid flexibility.

But while the future looks bright, many factors can influence your earning potential as a junior software developer. Here’s a breakdown of key considerations: industry, geographic location, and additional pay.

## Entry-level software engineer salaries by industry

The entry-level software engineering market in 2025 reveals that industry and sector has the biggest impact on job salary, with annual compensation ranging from $75,000 in the lowest tier industry to $250,000 in the highest paying industry—a difference of $64.90 per hour.

Unsurprisingly, fields offering premium pay deal with emerging technologies and specialized domains. Frontier AI labs, for example, lead the market with an average entry-level salary of $210,000, followed by big tech cloud infrastructure at $185,000, and ad tech at scaled platforms at $140,000.

## Career guidance for new graduates

Making the leap from applying to jobs to salary negotiations with a prospective employer can feel daunting as an entry-level software engineer. But it’s also a major career milestone. Here are some tips to help you make the most of it, so you can start your new career fairly compensated and in position for future growth.

## How to maximize your starting salary

Part of accepting any job offer for a salaried position is negotiating starting pay. This shouldn’t be an intimidating step, but rather an opportunity to hit a number or goal you have in mind to kickstart your entry-level software engineering career. These approaches can help you justify the number you’re looking for, not only when applying to positions, but also when accepting an offer.

### 1. Build your portfolio with business impact top of mind

Even for entry-level roles, developers who quantify their impact stand out significantly from those who just list technologies. That’s where an externship can come into play, but even if you only have a passion project under your belt, you can still find concrete ways to show your skills.

**Action steps:**

- Add a “Business Value” section to each project in your portfolio.
- Include metrics that show improvements (e.g. “Reduced load time by 40%”).
- Provide details like lines of code, users served, performance improvements, etc.

### 2. Research salary bands before applying to a role

Companies typically have some wriggle room in their salary bands, but the amount varies wildly by company, role, and level. Startups, for example, often have more flexibility than larger corporations. Across the board, though, flexibility is often on the lower end for junior roles.

**Action steps:**

- Use Levels.fyi to filter salaries by company, location, and “New Grad/Junior” specifically.
- Check Glassdoor, but take the result with a grain of salt since results skew lower.
- Join “Junior Dev” Discord and Slack communities and ask what people were offered.

### 3. Ask about total compensation in the first call

In tech, the salary number is often just the base of what you get paid. For example, while the listed range might be $70,000 to $80,000, with stock, bonuses, and benefits adding $15,000 to $25,000, that brings the total compensation much closer to ~$100,000 in annual pay.

**Action steps:**

- Ask the recruiter in the screening call to share the total compensation structure.
- Take notes on signing bonuses, equity vesting schedules, 401(k) matching, and health insurance costs.
- Calculate your “real take-home” figure accounting for all the details you uncover.

### 4. Don’t hedge yourself in during the negotiation stage

If you pitch a low number, companies will tend to pin you to it, even if they know you’re undervaluing yourself. Over half of employers (53%) are open to negotiating salaries, especially for entry-level positions. And it’s totally worth it — negotiating can result in an 11-20% increase in pay!

**Action steps:**

- Create a script for responding to compensation questions, for example: “I’m seeing ranges from $X to $Y for similar roles [10% higher than you’d accept]. I’m flexible based on the complete package.”
- Practice saying it out loud 10 times at least; it’ll feel weird at first.
- Tap a friend, mentor, or professional connection to practice in a natural conversation.

### 5. Wait 24 hours before responding to any offer

Whether you’re considering multiple offers (lucky you!) or over the moon to secure a competitive position, it’s best to let an offer letter breathe overnight. You can respond immediately to a recruiter to let them know it’s in your inbox and you’ll respond on the following business day.

**Action steps:**

- Review the offer letter in full; don’t skip the total compensation details.
- Make sure you understand details like vesting cliffs, non-compete radius, duration, and IP ownership for side projects.
- Look for red flags like multi-year cliffs on equity, broad non-competes, and IP clauses covering weekend projects.

## Skills in high demand

In addition to practical tips like learning how to research and negotiate total compensation, you can also improve your attractiveness to employers as an entry-level candidate by cultivating in-demand skills. For example, take these five capabilities that the highest paying software developer roles require: AI, cloud platforms, DevOps tools, security, and data engineering.

### AI/machine learning technologies

These include programming languages like Python, Java, R, and C++, big data analysis tools like Apache Flink, machine learning platforms like TensorFlow, deep learning programs like PyTorch, and AI security best practices.

### Cloud platforms

Familiarity in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and/or Microsoft Azure is a must if you’re considering a career in cloud computing, since these platforms are used by most businesses in the US.

### DevOps tools

A basic DevOps technical skillset includes C++ or Java, Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform, as well as network optimization and security, since they oversee the entire development process to ensure software and IT are aligned.

### Security

Cyber security skills include application security, network security and management, risk management, vulnerability management, incident investigations, DevSecOps, and preparing to attain your CompTIA Security+ certification.

### Data engineering

Similar to AI and machine learning, technical skills include SQL, Apache Spark, Kafka, predictive algorithms, statistical techniques, data mining methods, and soft skills like collaboration and attention to detail.

## It’s in your grasp

Deciding where to focus your career as an entry-level software engineer is a big decision—but filtering your aspirations through compensation can help make it easier. Especially as the marketplace changes in response to trends like AI.

Without a doubt, the 2025 entry-level software engineering market reflects the continued digital transformation across industries. Whether you decide to prioritize the stability of a traditional sector, or the earning potential of an emerging one, your success depends on strategic planning and continuous skill development.

### What level is a junior software engineer?

A junior software engineer is considered to be entry-level. That means possessing 0-2 years of relevant experience spanning externships or internships, portfolio projects (either with a company or personal or open-source), or part-time work. Most employers require demonstrable proof of a candidate’s skills during the hiring process, so developing these while upskilling is critical.

### What do you call a beginner software engineer?

Beginner software engineers can hold a variety of titles, including: Junior Software Developer, Entry-Level Software Engineer, Entry-Level Software Developer, or Junior Software Engineer. They can also be known by having the words “Associate” or “New Grad” in their title. If you’re unsure about the seniority level of a job posting, reference the required years of experience.
