## What is CSS art?

CSS art is a digital image created with Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) code instead of a design tool. Usually, CSS art will only use an HTML and a CSS file — no illustrations, images, or JavaScript to speak of.

While you see CSS designs on almost every modern website, CSS art goes beyond basic layout, background, and text formatting. Instead, it’s a visual technique that pushes the boundaries of what stylesheets can do.

That said, you won’t find CSS art on most websites. Instead, this creative artwork is mostly a side project for those with a web development career.

## Why do designers code CSS art?

A CSS illustration is usually worse for performance than a standard image.

The issue isn’t file size — it’s render speed. Browsers must calculate every shape, gradient, and shadow, which can be slower than displaying a static image.

So CSS art is usually a **side project**, not a production asset.

Why do it anyway?

- It’s a creative challenge
- It shows *deep* CSS mastery
- It’s a portfolio flex
- It attracts attention and opportunities

## How is CSS art made?

Despite how complex it looks, CSS art is built from many simple pieces.

### Shapes
- Built using `div`s and pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`)
- Controlled with `border-radius` and `clip-path`

### Gradients
- Used for lighting, depth, reflections, and skin tones
- Linear gradients for straight blends
- Radial gradients for circular effects

### Shadows
- `box-shadow` can be stacked hundreds or thousands of times
- One element can generate massive complexity

## How to get started with CSS art

1. Pick a simple subject
2. Break it into basic shapes
3. Minimize HTML elements
4. Use pseudo-elements, shadows, and gradients
5. Add detail and polish

That’s it. Build, tweak, repeat.

## Going beyond CSS art

CSS art is a great way to stretch your skills, but you don’t need to master it to build great websites.

Even without art-level complexity, CSS is one of the most powerful tools in web development. If you’re serious about front-end, learning CSS deeply is non-negotiable.
