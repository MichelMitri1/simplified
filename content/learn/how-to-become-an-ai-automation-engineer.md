## What is an AI automation engineer?

AI automation engineers find ways to automate business workflows using AI. They embed within a specific team like HR to streamline processes like onboarding new hires or recruiting candidates, or they work across teams to build efficiencies that boost a company’s bottom line and improve employee productivity and morale.

What differentiates AI automation engineers from other AI specialties is that they aren’t actually building AI engines from scratch. Rather, they help customize and integrate existing systems to fit a business’s needs.

## AI automation engineer vs. AI engineer: A comparison

AI automation engineers leverage AI tools and algorithms to automate tedious or time-consuming tasks. Meanwhile, AI engineers are the ones who actually design, build, and train those algorithms and core models.

For the most part, AI automation engineers have less technical expertise than AI engineers, meaning they aren’t as deep in coding, programming, software development, and machine learning. With this, AI automation engineering tends to be a better career path for AI beginners, or individuals who want to break into tech but don’t want to become highly technical, niche developers.

Think about it this way: An AI engineer might work for an AI company or product like OpenAI, Google’s Gemini, or Anthropic’s Claude. An AI automation engineer, on the other hand, could work for a company that uses these AI tools but in industries such as finance, legal, automotive, retail, and tech, among others.

Here’s a quick comparison between an AI engineer and an AI automation engineer:

| Role                       | Core focus                                          | Typical tasks                                                                                                                                   |

## What does an AI automation engineer actually do?

So now you understand what an AI automation engineer is, let’s explore what their job is like everyday.

An AI automation engineer's responsibilities may include some or all of the following:

- **Building AI-powered tools using prompt engineering and automated evaluations:** Prompt engineering involves fine-tuning what you input into an AI system to get the best results for your specific use case. Then, “best results” are determined by evaluations that test and measure how an AI service is performing so you can trust it’s doing its job properly.
- **Integrating AI components into existing business systems:** Researching, testing, monitoring, and embedding AI components that feel intuitive, drive outcomes, and improve efficiencies for staffers.
- **Developing production-grade internal applications with robust front-ends and back-ends:** Building tools that are usable for non-technical users (recruiters, marketers) and customizable for technical users (engineers, QA).
- **Collaborating with cross-functional teams to identify automation opportunities:** Gathering feedback, understanding pain points, aligning AI solutions to workflows and priorities.
- **Monitoring system performance and implementing maintenance strategies:** Diagnosing failures, freezes, and gaps in output, then shipping fixes.

Some examples of task automation an AI automation engineer might oversee or help implement include:

- Customer service chatbots and virtual assistants
- Invoice processing and data migration automation
- Report generation and business intelligence dashboards
- Predictive maintenance in manufacturing
- Document processing with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

For context, here’s a breakdown of what an AI automation engineer does compared to popular jobs like software engineer or machine learning engineer:
