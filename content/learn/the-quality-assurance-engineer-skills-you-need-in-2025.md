# The Quality Assurance Engineer Skills You Need in 2025

Like many other tech workers, quality assurance (QA) engineers need both **hard and soft skills** to be successful. But gathering these skills can be well worth it if you’re considering a career move — QA engineering is a **lucrative, stable, and accessible** path into tech.

Below, we break down what QA engineers do, the most important QA skills in 2025, and how to know if you’re a good fit for the role.

## What is a QA engineer or QA tester?

Quality assurance engineers help tech teams deliver software that:

- Works smoothly  
- Looks good  
- Is intuitive for users  

QA engineers are involved **throughout the development lifecycle**, catching bugs early and continuously — unlike quality control engineers, who usually test after launch.

Because of QA’s ongoing involvement, companies can safely use **CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous deployment)**, releasing small updates frequently instead of risky, massive changes.

A core part of the job is imagining worst-case user behavior and testing how software responds. This requires not only technical ability, but strong communication and collaboration skills.

## 5 hard skills that a QA engineer needs

### 1. Coding
QA engineers aren’t full-time programmers, but **coding is still essential**.

Knowing at least one language helps you:
- Understand how bugs happen  
- Provide clearer bug reports  
- Collaborate effectively with developers  

Common languages:
- **JavaScript** (front-end + back-end, beginner-friendly)
- **Ruby** (often back-end focused, sometimes ML-related)

---

### 2. Automation testing
Automation speeds up testing and reduces costs, making it a must-have skill.

Popular tools include:
- **Selenium** (web + mobile, multi-language support)
- **Puppeteer** (Chrome / Chromium, Google-built)
- **WebdriverIO** (JavaScript-focused testing)

Manual testing still matters, but automation gives you a major edge.

---

### 3. SQL or basic database knowledge
Databases are everywhere.

SQL helps QA engineers:
- Validate stored data
- Catch inconsistencies
- Test migrations
- Work with data-heavy applications

This skill is especially valuable in finance, healthcare, and analytics-heavy companies.

---

### 4. API knowledge
APIs allow systems to communicate with each other.

QA engineers should understand:
- How APIs work
- How to test them
- The difference between public and private APIs  

API testing ensures security, scalability, and reliable integrations.

---

### 5. Project management tools (Jira, YouTrack)
QA work lives inside project management systems.

Tools like **Jira** or **YouTrack** help you:
- Track bugs
- Understand sprint progress
- Coordinate with dev teams
- Meet deadlines  

Seeing these tools on your resume signals that you’re team-ready and organized.

## 5 soft skills for quality assurance engineers

### 1. Problem solving
QA engineers are professional problem hunters.

Strong problem solvers:
- Spot edge cases
- Think analytically
- Notice details others miss  

Many careers already build this skill: editors, IT technicians, researchers, and analysts all translate well into QA.

---

### 2. Time management
QA teams work in **sprints**, which means deadlines matter.

You’ll need to:
- Balance multiple test cases
- Prioritize bugs
- Avoid last-minute overload before releases  

If you’ve worked in events, film, TV, education, or operations, you likely already have this skill.

---

### 3. Patience
Bug fixing is repetitive and iterative.

QA engineers need patience to:
- Retest fixes multiple times
- Handle feedback from many stakeholders
- Persist through slow debugging cycles  

Teaching, customer service, and caregiving backgrounds transfer well here.

---

### 4. Creativity
Great QA engineers think like users *and* hackers.

Creativity helps you:
- Imagine unexpected failure cases
- Design better test scenarios
- Build smarter automation solutions  

Many artists, designers, and creative thinkers thrive in QA roles.

---

### 5. Communication
QA engineers surface problems — clearly and diplomatically.

You’ll need to:
- Write concise bug reports
- Explain technical issues to non-technical stakeholders
- Collaborate across teams  

If you’ve ever presented ideas, handled clients, or worked cross-functionally, you already have this foundation.

---

## How to improve your quality assurance skills

Once you have the basics, growth comes from **practice and exposure**.

Ways to level up:
- Volunteer for testing tasks at your current job
- Shadow developers or QA engineers
- Find a mentor with a similar career path
- Attend QA events and conferences
- Contribute to open-source projects on GitHub
- Build a testing portfolio with real examples

You can also pursue certifications or structured learning. QA-focused bootcamps are designed specifically for beginners and often offer flexible schedules for working professionals or parents.

---

### Final takeaway

QA engineering in 2025 is:
- In-demand  
- Accessible to career changers  
- Technically engaging  
- Financially rewarding  

If you enjoy problem-solving, communication, and improving systems, QA is one of the **best entry points into tech** right now.
