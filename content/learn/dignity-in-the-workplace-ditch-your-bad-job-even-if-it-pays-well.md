# Dignity in the Workplace: Ditch Your Bad Job, Even if It Pays Well

There are many ways that bad jobs can be truly disastrous — bad pay, a toxic work environment, inhumane hours. But there is one thing that almost every bad job shares: they ask you to sacrifice your dignity in addition to your time. So, for example, not only do you have to take the graveyard shift on a support line, you also have to gracefully accept the abuse misdirected towards you by irate customers.

It doesn’t have to be this way. You can have a career that is both well-paid and dignified. In fact, it might be easier to make this pivot than you think.

## Institutional disrespect

A person’s sense of professional dignity doesn’t have to be tied to external factors such as how well they’re treated — honest labor is dignified regardless of what job someone has. But it’s easier for workers to achieve a sense of professional dignity when institutions treat them with respect. And for many positions, that’s not a sure thing.

In *Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America*, Barbara Ehrenreich temporarily ditches her middle-class life and goes undercover to see what it’s like to be a low-wage worker. Not only does she find that one of these jobs is far from enough to cover her minimal expenses, she’s also exposed to mistreatment that is, in a word, humiliating.

A mandatory meeting is called. She and her coworkers shuffle into a break room where they each have lockers to store their personal belongings. Their manager reminds them that these lockers can be searched at any time and goes on to announce a change in policy: now, when workers are not on the clock, they’re no longer allowed to eat at the restaurant because this leads to “gossip,” otherwise known as employees just talking to one another.

Four days after that, everyone is called into the kitchen for another meeting. “Drug activity” was reported, so all new hires will have to go through pre-screening for drugs. In addition, all current employees will also be subject to random testing. Even though Ehrenreich wasn’t the source of the “activity,” she nonetheless blushes. This all leads her to reflect:

> I haven’t been treated this way—lined up in the corridor, threatened with locker searches, peppered with carelessly aimed accusations—since at least junior high school.  
> *Barbara Ehrenreich, Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America*

The employees are adults. But, as Ehrenreich rightfully points out, her manager is treating them like children.

A 2023 American Psychological Association (APA) survey found that **95%** of respondents said it was important for them to feel respected at work. Of that percentage, **66%** said it was very important.

## Wage theft

Disrespect is a hard thing to measure because it’s subjective. However, we *can* measure one institutional way companies mistreat their workers: **wage theft**.

Examples include:

- Managers taking tips  
- Being told to work through a lunch break  
- Unauthorized deductions from pay  
- Delayed payment of final wages  
- Bounced paychecks  
- Forced overtime  

According to the Economic Opportunity Institute, wage theft is the **most profitable form of theft in the United States**. Employers steal an estimated **$15 billion annually** from workers.

## Education is the door to dignity

Nearly every type of labor is worthy of respect. But reality doesn’t always follow values.

According to The Survey Center on American Life:

> “College-educated workers appear to have more positive work environments.”

Two-thirds (**67%**) of workers with a bachelor’s degree or higher report that they are often treated fairly, compared to **55%** of workers with a high school education or less.

Lower-respect jobs also ranked lower in pay.
