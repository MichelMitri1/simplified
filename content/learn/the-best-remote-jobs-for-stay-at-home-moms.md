## FAQ

### What are the best work from home jobs for moms with no experience?

Work during naps, early mornings, or after bedtime. Be upfront about your availability. Start part-time if needed. Set boundaries and build a simple routine.

Never pay money for a “job.” Research companies (Glassdoor/BBB). Avoid vague posts promising huge money fast. Use reputable boards like Remote.co or We Work Remotely.

Not always. Entry-level roles can be accessible with basic computer skills. But certifications can raise income (Google Digital Garage, Coursera, HubSpot, bookkeeping/project management certs).
