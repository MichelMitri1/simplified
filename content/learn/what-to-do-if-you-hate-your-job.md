# What to Do If You Hate Your Job

On good days, you get to your office in an hour and fifteen minutes. During your commute, you listen to music, comedy podcasts, anything in an attempt to build internal resilience and protect your mental health. After a draining work day, you spend another hour and fifteen minutes getting home, feeling overwhelmed. While you sit in traffic that’s as familiar as it is dreary, it hits you: you hate your job.

You’re not alone. And while people hate their jobs for unique reasons, there are some overarching themes we’ve noticed. Looking for clarity on what’s making your job satisfaction tank? We can help.

And no, we’re not going to just wallow. Once you identify the problem, you can finally start addressing it. So here’s why you hate your job and what to do about it. Because we’re sure things can change.

Let’s jump in.

## Why do I hate my job? 3 potential reasons

### Reason 1: I hate my job because of the company culture

Company culture is a fairly nebulous concept, but we think you’ll understand why we’re starting here. See, it encompasses everything from how your boss interacts with you to hours expected of employees to turnover rate.

And this all affects your mental and physical health. Just imagine (and if you don’t have to imagine, we’ll just say we’re sorry you’re the captive of this hypothetical): you come into work the day after someone on your team was fired seemingly arbitrarily. Your boss hasn’t communicated reasons for the termination other than that your colleague “wasn’t cutting it.” It’s the third time you’ve heard this in the previous month. And because you don’t want to lose your job, you decide that you’re going to work extra hours that day to make sure you’re one of the people who “cuts it.”

It’s a spiral. A toxic work culture infects nearly every aspect of a job. Not only does it make you feel like you have reduced job security, it encourages you to engage in self-destructive work behavior that decimates your work-life balance, leading to an unsatisfying personal life in addition to your job dissatisfaction.

Maybe you stick it out because your job’s in an industry you love. Maybe you’re allowed to work on projects that are nonetheless exciting. But there’s much more to a job than your daily tasks. There are the people you work with and the situation in which you do the work.

Take AC Slamet for example. He was a producer for unscripted TV, and he was in an industry he thought was right for him. But the actuality of working this job was wearing him down. “A normal shoot day for producers would be 15 hours,” he said.

In addition, because he had to be on set filming the stars’ holiday events, he had to miss celebrations with his loved ones. “You tend to miss a lot of important life things. You sometimes have to miss birthdays. You miss anniversaries. You miss people’s graduations. It’s tough.”

#### What to do about it

When you hate your job because of the company culture, it’s too easy to redirect the impetus for change inward. “Maybe if I just stay positive,” you tell yourself, “I can find more joy in my career.” Or “Maybe if I just work harder, I won’t feel overwhelmed later.” Or “Maybe if I meet my boss’s shifting, arbitrary expectations, I’ll get some recognition.”

These are all strands of logic that don’t do anything to address the core issue that makes you hate to go to work: the culture. That’s what truly needs to change.

Start by having a conversation with your manager. Prepare specific examples of unhelpful behaviors and suggestions for change beforehand. Enter the conversation with equanimity.

In the hypothetical above, this might sound like:

> “When people seem to be fired for no reason, this makes the rest of the team feel insecure in their jobs, which makes it difficult for us to do our work. In the future, please share the specific reasons for terminations.”

If your manager is the source of the unhealthy work environment (or unwilling or unable to do anything with your feedback), take your concerns a level higher. If that doesn’t work, reach out to HR.

Ultimately, if your advocacy fails to alter the culture, you might have to revert to individual action. But for each individual action, ask yourself if you’re accommodating the culture or if you’re asking the culture to accommodate you.

Here’s what we mean:

- If you decide you’ll always be available to put out fires caused by poor processes, you’re accommodating the culture.
- If you turn your work phone off in the evenings and on weekends, you’re not capitulating — you’re setting boundaries.

Other ways to address a rough culture:

- **Maintain your own integrity**  
  Don’t let a toxic culture alter your values.
- **Engage in positive self-talk every night**  
  Remind yourself you are not your job, and list three good things you did that day.
- **Take breaks**  
  Step back regularly and refresh yourself.
- **Cultivate a support network**  
  Confide in coworkers and listen to their concerns.
- **Practice intentional disengagement**  
  Be picky about the causes you take up.
- **Lead by example**  
  Model the behaviors you’d like to see across the organization.

### Reason 2: I hate my job tasks

Sometimes, the culture is fine — but the day-to-day tasks drain you.

Instead of vague anxiety, you may dread something specific:

You know you’ll build that spreadsheet again. Same thing as last month. And the month before. It’s not even vital, but you still need to track and report everything “just in case.” And you have to manually enter data because… reasons.

It can also be a deeper mismatch. Luke Schmidt thought he was doing everything right: he was nearly finished with an economics degree. And yet something felt wrong. He left school, worked odd jobs, then discovered tech when he wrote a script that made an LED light strip blink.

> “I hadn't really experienced that before: where I had done something from a work-related standpoint and had actually been excited about the process and the completion of it.”  
> — Luke Schmidt, TripleTen grad

#### What to do about it

If the work itself is the problem, there’s a silver lining: you can clearly identify the source of dissatisfaction. But the tasks may be less malleable than the culture.

Start by talking to your manager. Explain your dissatisfaction and ask if responsibilities can shift to give you more variety. You can also ask about training opportunities — and even propose enrolling in a course to grow into new responsibilities.

Other ways to breathe life into stale work:

- **Discover or re-engage in a hobby**  
  Connect effort to reward by investing in activities you enjoy.
- **Listen to music or podcasts**  
  Turn low-effort tasks into opportunities to enjoy something.
- **Establish and stick to time limits**  
  Build a schedule so drudgery doesn’t take over.
- **Find places for personal expression**  
  Make your workspace a place you want to be.
- **Reframe your perspective**  
  Look for and express gratitude for upsides.
- **Look to the future**  
  Connect today’s tasks to where you want to be later.

### Reason 3: I hate my job because of the low salary

Maybe you don’t dislike working. Maybe the culture is fine. But you’re getting paid the same as five years ago — and your bills definitely aren’t.

Your feelings about losing purchasing power are valid.

If you made the U.S. median household income of **$68,703 in 2019**, inflation would mean you’d need **$84,180 today** to have the same purchasing power — a loss of over **$15,000** if your pay didn’t increase.

Even if you got an average **3% raise annually**, your purchasing power could still decrease — inflation still wins.

This doesn’t make you greedy. It reflects a real understanding of your economic situation.

And it can go beyond pay:

- Higher healthcare costs
- Weaker benefits
- Less support from your employer

Even if we’re told to work “for passion,” the reality is you exchange labor for money and benefits. It’s fair to feel frustrated when that exchange gets worse over time.

#### What to do about it

The good news: it’s not that you hate work — it’s that the exchange feels lopsided.

Still, that doesn’t fix it. So:

1. **Ask for a raise.**  
   Bring research. Use concrete examples of your impact. Look up market rates. Timing helps — ask after a win.

2. **Be politely persistent.**  
   Companies move slowly. Follow up until you get a clear answer.

If you’re turned down, don’t get discouraged. Wait six months, build another win, and ask again.

Other ways to improve your situation:

- **Negotiate flexible hours**  
  If you can’t get more money, you might get more time.
- **Improve your skills**  
  Upskill into higher-level roles with better pay.
- **Discuss better benefits with HR**  
  Health insurance and retirement contributions matter.
- **Explore other compensation**  
  Variable pay schemes or stock options.
- **Ask for additional PTO**  
  Extra vacation time can help.
- **Modify your tasks**  
  A different workload can offset the stagnation.

## What to do if you hate your job: signs it’s time to quit

We’ve been focusing on improving things if you want to stay — but sometimes you need to leave.

AC left the TV industry and became a data analyst. Luke moved from odd jobs into software development. Both were better off.

Luke reflected:

> “I plan to continue to allow myself the freedom to do the things that I want to do, and put 100% into my job and my work. Because it's been really rewarding to me.”  
> — Luke Schmidt, TripleTen grad

AC stopped working weekends and holidays. “It’s a breath of fresh air,” he said.

Signs it’s time to quit:

- **Your physical or mental health has deteriorated**  
  Chronic stress can lead to anxiety, depression, burnout, and physical symptoms.
- **You feel contempt for company leadership**  
  You no longer respect how the company is run.
- **The work environment is irreparably toxic**  
  Bullying, discrimination, harassment persist despite efforts.
- **Your values clash with the company’s values**  
  Your beliefs no longer align with the organization.
- **You have no opportunities for growth**  
  No training, no advancement, no path forward.

If you’re stuck in a loop of waking up thinking “I despise my job,” and nothing changes — you may need a bigger move.

## FAQ

### Is it normal to hate your job?

You're not alone — 50–60% of people are unhappy or checked out at work, according to research. Just because it's common doesn't mean you should accept it forever. Constant dissatisfaction affects your mental health, relationships, and quality of life. It’s a strong signal something needs to change.

### Can I quit my job for mental health reasons?

Yes. Mental health is a valid reason to leave a job. Depending on your situation, you might qualify for FMLA leave to get breathing room while keeping your job. Some people quit without something lined up when their health is at risk. Consider whether you qualify for unemployment or disability benefits where you live, and talk to a doctor about what makes sense.

### Do I hate my job or am I depressed?

Depression can make everything feel worse, including jobs that would normally be tolerable. If you’re also exhausted all the time, losing interest in things you used to enjoy, sleeping irregularly, or feeling hopeless even on weekends, consider talking to a mental health professional. They can help you sort out whether your job is making you depressed, or depression is making you hate your job.

### What should I do if I hate my job but can't afford to quit?

Start job searching while you’re still employed. Update your resume, reach out to your network, and apply off the clock. Trim expenses where you can and build savings. Set small daily goals to get through the workday. Being employed can also help your negotiating power for the next role.

### I hate my job, but it pays well. Should I stay?

A big paycheck doesn’t matter much if you’re miserable. Figure out what you actually need to live, and what the money is costing you: mental health, time, happiness. Plenty of people take pay cuts and end up better off. Sometimes the smartest money move is earning less in exchange for a better life.

### How do I know if I really hate my job or if it's just a bad week?

If you’ve been dreading work most days for months, feeling sick on Sunday evenings, or you can’t name a single thing you like anymore, it’s probably not just a rough patch. Everyone has bad weeks — but constant misery is your brain telling you something’s wrong and needs action.
